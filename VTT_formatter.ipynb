    "The `.vtt` file is read into the `VttFormatter` class using the `import_file` method. This opend the file and appends each line in the file to a list.\n",
    "This list is looped over and each line is added to a dictionary depending on the information contained in the line using the `create_dictionary` method. \n",
    "The text is the reformatted to ensure the text flows conversationally based on the start/stop time stamps contained in the original file using the `format_text` method and the reformatted text is written to a new `.txt` file using the name of the original file in the `reformat_vtt` method.\n",

And So what we had yeah, we had to work very, very fast. I understand and then do you then think when you said that they approached other members of Parliament, an with? What are what was then what would the benefit for those MPs be we do not know but our suspicion is that they would have been given money money. Yeah, that is what we suspect because there was no reason for somebody to stand up, and say that tobacco is good when you. No yeah that it is not yeah, and wasn't then then because I mean, this argument about tobacco farming is obviously very contested and I mean, there are there are also people who say that that kind of switching to another crop is actually a possibility, but probably arguments like that.

We brought them to the parliament committee and they explained how much they are. Coughing how their wars are dark how they have lost people and they don't know they think that they could have died of cancer from tobacco smoking.

Newspaper articles on how where pharmaca doing they would also print their their monthly returns and show how much they are giving to government. They would do so. They used different methods. The not ledger, not direct except for the hearing for the public hearing. They brought they they brought people who said that the tobacco is not as harmful and he it is useful for farmers and it is paying school fees. It is also paying a good taxes to government and was that was that. Am at where they were there people who said that they are from the companies or where they I don't know medical doctors that we didn't have medical doctors there. Fortunately, we did not have scientists there, but they had lawyers. They had their own lawyer speaking on their behalf. Yeah, they also had individual farmers. Farmers members of Parliament in video members of parliament. Who come especially those who come from tobacco growing areas? Yeah. Those were openly saying that you know you cannot take tobacco from people the tobacco industry is supplementing mean growing of tobacco. So it's not a good argument to say that the back is very useless and how how do you think so this especially the situation of the public hearing? What was about the media? How did state? For example, than then report on what was happening. How was how was the tobacco industry portrayed for example, there. We we, we trade for instance, to resist because they for the for one of the major media companies told us late for us. We're here to balance the argument.

Oh yeah, yeah, yes and of course, as you may know the buckle industry also went to court, yeah. So they're they're they're contesting the aspects of the low. Yeah, about the decision right yes. Yes, there was a decision in a favor, yeah, when she hopefully celebrated. Yes yes very much. But of course, they're also doing some their marketing in in ways that are not easily.

We were also wondering whether the president would sign it or he would say go back and change some of these things and why, why do you think? What is what is time use suspicion? Why do you think he signed it? Why did he decide that was that is all the things we did in parliament, even when we proposed 18 years and we propose.',\n",

Ministry of trade yes, yeah, Yeah, an off my mean in many, many cases I think the Ministry of trade is quite powerful, especially then compare to administrator for hell? Yes, even though obviously we pass and they don't agree with. This Unfortunately, but because you see, there many for instance, when we try to enforce the. The low in in we have done many supervision and arrest Sunday.

How do you understand is the situation with with alisa? Black women in Uganda at the moment, there is a lot of of tobacco that is coming in that first of all.

So when you mean facts? How do you then or based on? On what? So where did you get your information from did you look into? What research has been done, or did you look at kind of data that is for example, available there from the World Health Organization or how? How did you decide what information for use in? What 2 things one we would see what the tobacco industry is doing on the ground. Yes, Hey, Andy and be able to see how they're saving too.

For example, about the the pictures that you have been using it sounded as if those were pictures, mostly then relating to kind of the health consequences of consuming tobacco an did you also then have information that you used and kind of tobacco farming and for example, illicit trade or is that something like that. When we don't have OK. There is that because you feel that there is less data available or less information available or is that? There because I think you have. We need to do walk on it. We need to do one of the other things we have not been able to do adequately is a collecting information collecting. Local information we have global literature, yeah, Yeah, but we it would have been good to have more specific like one farming. We don't have yeah. I understand like on dirt illicit trade.

Yeah, the global and he's probably is it also when we have been thinking about kind of maybe small asses society.

I have no clear idea of their of what I went want to develop because the data is backed are kind of comes from from you so therefore, I need to see what happens.

What do you do at that some of the members of parliament would also be really nice and yeah, I can try and see whether we can get the the the the person who proposed the beer and the second are now ministers. They were not ministers at that time, so they they are difficult to get but I can look out. Yeah, that would be fantastic. But for now, so it is just that we are kind of thinking about. Doing it and I just wanted to kind of ask you now if you think that they could be then. You could maybe help us.
