Picking up your feet.
 
Yeah.
 
But now my headphones or what the boy, I could it still yeah well. I mean, it's it. It will still be recording the audio. It's just not playing in through the speakers to see something in there, if you click. The 3:00 dots. I saw something that said turn off incoming video so that would turn off.
